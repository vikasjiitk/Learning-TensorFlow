#Learning TensorFlow
This Repository is meant for learning the TensorFlow API by building simple Machine Learning tasks.  
Most of the code written here is taken from the TensorFlow [official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/index.html) provided.

## Examples

1. MNIST data classification using Logistic Regression. [MNISTclassification.py](https://github.com/vikasjiitk/Learning-TensorFlow/blob/master/Examples/MNISTclassification.py)
